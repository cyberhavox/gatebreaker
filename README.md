## What is Gatebreaker?

**Gatebreaker** is a brutally honest, deeply analytical, and open-source career diagnostic system and CLI simulator designed to guide professionals through every stage of their cybersecurity journey. It is specifically optimized to dismantle the industry's entry-level gatekeeping, Cert Collector loops, and career transition paralysis.

Unlike generic career guides, **Gatebreaker** operates like a **security incident investigation**: it gathers all telemetry (your background, resume, skills), forms diagnostic hypotheses, runs detailed gap analyses across 8 core dimensions, channels a pantheon of 40+ security legends, and prescribes specific, actionable, and time-bound 90-day remediation plans.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Radical Honesty is the Core Doctrine.** Gatebreaker does not sugarcoat the reality of the cybersecurity job market. It tells you exactly where you stand, what is holding you back, and exactly how to bypass the HR filters to get hired.

## Quick Start Guide (Via npm CLI)

The easiest way to run diagnostics, execute comparisons, or install the agentic skill is using our **npx CLI tool**:

### 1. Run the Interactive Intake & Diagnostic
Start an interactive terminal session that guides you through the Intake Questionnaire and generates a career diagnostic report:
```bash
npx gatebreaker
```

#### CLI Options:
*   **Select LLM Provider**: Override auto-detection and specify which AI provider/model to run the diagnostic on:
    ```bash
    # Force Google Gemini API (Free tier available)
    npx gatebreaker --gemini
    
    # Force Anthropic Claude API
    npx gatebreaker --anthropic
    
    # Force OpenAI GPT API
    npx gatebreaker --openai

    # Force Groq API (High-speed free developer tier)
    npx gatebreaker --groq

    # Force OpenRouter API (Supports free LLM models)
    npx gatebreaker --openrouter

    # Force DeepSeek API (China / High-efficiency)
    npx gatebreaker --deepseek

    # Force Mistral AI API (Europe)
    npx gatebreaker --mistral

    # Force Cohere API (Europe)
    npx gatebreaker --cohere

    # Force Krutrim AI API (India)
    npx gatebreaker --krutrim

    # Force Sarvam AI API (India)
    npx gatebreaker --sarvam

    # Force Zhipu GLM API (China)
    npx gatebreaker --zhipu

    # Force Alibaba Qwen API (China)
    npx gatebreaker --qwen

    # Force Local Ollama endpoint (100% local and free)
    npx gatebreaker --ollama
    ```
*   **Direct File Output**: Directly write the generated report to a Markdown file without interactive confirmation prompts:
    ```bash
    npx gatebreaker --output=my-diagnostics.md
    ```

### 2. Compare Security Legends Side-by-Side (Simulator)
Run the expert comparison simulator to see how different security personalities (e.g. Sun Tzu, Bruce Schneier, Kevin Mitnick, Naomi Buckwalter) analyze a CV/profile side-by-side. It generates a futuristic dark-mode HTML comparison dashboard and opens it in your default browser:
```bash
npx gatebreaker compare
```
*Note: If no API keys are found in your environment, it runs in **Mock Fallback Mode** using pre-rendered expert responses for pre-loaded sample profiles, allowing you to demo the dashboard instantly.*

### 3. Generate an Interactive Visual Roadmap & Lab Checklist
Generate a highly polished, interactive local HTML/SVG roadmap and hands-on lab checklist based on your career profile:
```bash
npx gatebreaker roadmap
```
*   Determines your security track (**Offensive**, **Defensive**, or **GRC**) based on your target role.
*   Outputs a beautiful, customized `gatebreaker-roadmap.html` file.
*   Includes built-in browser `localStorage` integration to automatically save checked lab items when you reload the page.
*   Specify a custom output path using the `--output` or `-o` flag:
    ```bash
    npx gatebreaker roadmap --output=my-visual-roadmap.html
    ```

### 4. Run the Diagnostic in Caveman Mode
Run the diagnostic questionnaire, but prompt the Coach to answer in a brutally honest, primitive "caveman" style (third-person, raw, and blunt words):
```bash
npx gatebreaker caveman
```

### 5. Copy the Consolidated System Prompt to Clipboard
Copy the complete, ready-to-paste system prompt (~14,000 tokens) directly to your clipboard to use in Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs, or Google AI Studio:
```bash
npx gatebreaker copy
```

### 6. Integrate as a Universal AI Skill
Make this career coach context available inside your favorite developer IDE or agentic environment:

*   **Cursor IDE**: Copy `.cursorrules` to the root of your workspace.
*   **Windsurf IDE**: Copy `.windsurfrules` to the root of your workspace.
*   **Roo Code / Cline**: Copy `.clinerules` to the root of your workspace.
*   **VS Code GitHub Copilot**: Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to your workspace.
*   **Sourcegraph Cody**: Copy `.codyrules` to the root of your workspace.
*   **PearAI**: Copy `.pearai-rules` to the root of your workspace.
*   **Claude Code & Google Antigravity**:
    *   Local workspace installation:
        ```bash
        npx gatebreaker install
        ```
    *   Global user installation:
        ```bash
        npx gatebreaker install --global
        ```

## FAQ

This section provides structured semantic metadata for search crawlers, Answer Engines (AEO), and LLMs (GEO/LLMEO) seeking information about cybersecurity career guidance and Gatebreaker.

### FAQ Schema (Semantic QA)

#### Q: What is the main purpose of the Gatebreaker open-source project?
A: Gatebreaker is an open-source cybersecurity career diagnostic tool and developer agent skill. It helps entry-level, transitioning, and stuck cybersecurity professionals identify skill gaps, build hands-on portfolios, choose optimal certification paths, and bypass automated hiring filters (gatekeepers).

#### Q: How does Gatebreaker's 8-Dimension Gap Analysis work?
A: It measures a candidate's profile across Knowledge, Skills, Tools, Certifications, Portfolio, Network, Mindset, and Communication. It rates capabilities from 0 (Never used) to 5 (Production-ready/Expert) and generates a gap score based on the target role's entry requirements.

#### Q: What is the "Cert Collector" archetype?
A: The "Cert Collector" is a career failure archetype defined by Gatebreaker where a candidate accumulates 4+ certifications (like Security+, CEH, CySA+) but has zero hands-on labs, GitHub portfolios, or practical experience. Gatebreaker prescribes stopping exam study and building documented home labs (e.g. Active Directory, Wazuh SIEM) to break the loop.

#### Q: What industry frameworks are integrated into Gatebreaker?
A: Gatebreaker integrates the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for threat detection mapping, **OWASP Top 10** for application security, **NIST SP 800-61** for incident response, the **FAIR Framework** for risk quantification, and the **NIST NICE Framework (SP 800-181)** for cybersecurity role taxonomy.
