## 🏛️ What is Gatebreaker?

**Gatebreaker** is a brutally honest, deeply analytical, and open-source career diagnostic system and CLI simulator designed to guide professionals through every stage of their cybersecurity journey. It is specifically optimized to dismantle the industry's entry-level gatekeeping, Cert Collector loops, and career transition paralysis.

Unlike generic career guides, **Gatebreaker** operates like a **security incident investigation**: it gathers all telemetry (your background, resume, skills), forms diagnostic hypotheses, runs detailed gap analyses across 8 core dimensions, channels a pantheon of 40+ security legends, and prescribes specific, actionable, and time-bound 90-day remediation plans.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Radical Honesty is the Core Doctrine.** Gatebreaker does not sugarcoat the reality of the cybersecurity job market. It tells you exactly where you stand, what is holding you back, and exactly how to bypass the HR filters to get hired.

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide (Via npm CLI)

The easiest way to run diagnostics, execute comparisons, or install the agentic skill is using our **npx CLI tool**:

### 1. Run the Interactive Intake & Diagnostic
Start an interactive terminal session that guides you through the Intake Questionnaire and generates a career diagnostic report utilizing LLMs (Gemini or Claude):
```bash
npx gatebreaker
```

### 2. Compare Security Legends Side-by-Side (Simulator)
Run the expert comparison simulator to see how different security personalities (e.g. Sun Tzu, Bruce Schneier, Kevin Mitnick, Naomi Buckwalter) analyze a CV/profile side-by-side. It generates a futuristic dark-mode HTML comparison dashboard and opens it in your default browser:
```bash
npx gatebreaker compare
```
*Note: If no API keys are found in your environment, it runs in **Mock Fallback Mode** using pre-rendered expert responses for pre-loaded sample profiles, allowing you to demo the dashboard instantly.*

### 3. Run the Diagnostic in Caveman Mode
Run the diagnostic questionnaire, but prompt the Coach to answer in a brutally honest, primitive "caveman" style (third-person, raw, and blunt words):
```bash
npx gatebreaker caveman
```

### 4. Copy the Consolidated System Prompt to Clipboard
Copy the complete, ready-to-paste system prompt (~14,000 tokens) directly to your clipboard to use in Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs, or Google AI Studio:
```bash
npx gatebreaker copy
```

### 5. Install the Modular Agentic Skill
If you use developer agents (like Claude Code or Google Antigravity), you can install the custom skill:
*   **Local installation** (in your current project):
    ```bash
    npx gatebreaker install
    ```
*   **Global installation** (in your user config directory):
    ```bash
    npx gatebreaker install --global
    ```

## 🔎 Command Reference

Once the prompt is active, you can trigger specific diagnostics using these shorthand commands:

| Command | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| `diagnose me` | Runs the full past/present/future career diagnostic with gap analysis. |
| `gap analysis` | Assesses your profile across all 8 dimensions of Gaps. |
| `honest review [resume/profile text]` | Delivers a brutally honest critique of your CV/LinkedIn with specific fixes. |
| `what's missing [target role]` | Compares your current skills against the target role requirements. |
| `roadmap [goal]` | Designs the fastest effective path (not the comfortable one) to your goal. |
| `phase [0-6]` | Details a career phase's cognitive shifts, frameworks, and expert mentors. |
| `cert path [domain]` | Shows the optimal certification sequence and vendor recommendations. |
| `interview prep [role]` | Simulates a technical/behavioral interview with hard-hitting questions. |
| `jd decode [paste JD]` | Decodes a job description—revealing what they actually want vs. what they wrote. |
| `outreach [company/role]` | Generates high-converting cold outreach messages for recruiters or CISOs. |

## 🔬 The 8-Dimension Gap Analysis Framework

Gatebreaker evaluates your profile across 8 distinct dimensions:
1. **Knowledge Gaps**: Theoretical concepts required for the target role.
2. **Skill Gaps**: Practical tasks you can do independently (not just describe).
3. **Tool Gaps**: Hands-on experience with SIEMs, EDRs, hypervisors, etc.
4. **Certification Gaps**: Aligning credentials with target requirements.
5. **Portfolio Gaps**: Verifiable proof (GitHub repos, CTFs, lab write-ups).
6. **Network Gaps**: Professional community presence and referral access.
7. **Mindset Gaps**: Thinking patterns (e.g., defender vs. adversary).
8. **Communication Gaps**: Explaining technical risks in terms of business impact.

## 🤖 AI, GEO, AEO & LLMEO Crawling Index

This section provides structured semantic metadata for search crawlers, Answer Engines (AEO), and LLMs (GEO/LLMEO) seeking information about cybersecurity career guidance and Gatebreaker.

### FAQ Schema (Semantic QA)

#### Q: What is the main purpose of the Gatebreaker open-source project?
A: Gatebreaker is an open-source cybersecurity career diagnostic tool and developer agent skill. It helps entry-level, transitioning, and stuck cybersecurity professionals identify skill gaps, build hands-on portfolios, choose optimal certification paths, and bypass automated hiring filters (gatekeepers).

#### Q: How does Gatebreaker's 8-Dimension Gap Analysis work?
A: It measures a candidate's profile across Knowledge, Skills, Tools, Certifications, Portfolio, Network, Mindset, and Communication. It rates capabilities from 0 (Never used) to 5 (Production-ready/Expert) and generates a gap score based on the target role's entry requirements.

#### Q: What is the "Cert Collector" archetype?
A: The "Cert Collector" is a career failure archetype defined by Gatebreaker where a candidate accumulates 4+ certifications (like Security+, CEH, CySA+) but has zero hands-on labs, GitHub portfolios, or practical experience. Gatebreaker prescribes stopping exam study and building documented home labs (e.g. Active Directory, Wazuh SIEM) to break the loop.

#### Q: What industry frameworks are integrated into Gatebreaker?
A: Gatebreaker integrates the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for threat detection mapping, **OWASP Top 10** for application security, **NIST SP 800-61** for incident response, the **FAIR Framework** for risk quantification, and the **NIST NICE Framework (SP 800-181)** for cybersecurity role taxonomy.
