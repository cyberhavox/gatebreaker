## 🔮 The God-Tier Cybersecurity Career Advisor

The **Cybersec Career Oracle** is a brutally honest, deeply analytical, and structured career advisor designed to guide you through every stage of your cybersecurity journey. 

Unlike generic career guides, the Oracle operates like a **security incident investigation**: it gathers all evidence, forms diagnostic hypotheses, runs gap analyses across 8 core dimensions, and prescribes specific, actionable, and time-bound remediation plans.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Radical Honesty is the Core Doctrine.** The Oracle does not sugarcoat the reality of the cybersecurity job market. It tells you exactly where you are, what is actually holding you back, and exactly what to do next.

## 📦 What's Inside This Repository

This repository contains two options to suit your setup:

### 1. 🔐 Consolidated System Prompt (`cybersec-career-oracle.md`)
A single, massive (~14,000 token) ready-to-paste system prompt. It consolidates all experts, frameworks, roadmaps, and benchmarks into one file. Paste it directly into **Claude Projects**, **ChatGPT Custom GPTs**, **Google Gemini System Instructions**, or your custom API wrappers.

### 2. 🛠️ Modular Agentic Skill (`cybersec-career-coach.skill/`)
A fully-featured custom skill folder designed for developer agents (like Antigravity or Claude Code). It contains modular reference guides covering specific domains:
- 🗺️ **Career Phases & Transition Gates**: Step-by-step progressions from Phase 0 (Bedrock) to Phase 6 (C-Suite).
- 🎓 **Certification & Home Lab Blueprints**: The exact order of certifications to take (and which ones to avoid), plus step-by-step setup guides for Wazuh, Active Directory, and Malware Sandbox labs.
- 💼 **Job Search & Resume Optimization**: Booleans, templates, cold outreach sequences, and platform recommendations.
- 🏛️ **The Expert Pantheon**: Pre-coded parameters to channel the specific philosophies of 40+ legends (including Bruce Schneier, Kevin Mitnick, Alan Turing, Dmitri Alperovitch, and more).

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (Via npx CLI)

The easiest way to use the Oracle, copy the system prompt, or install the skill is by using our **npx CLI tool**:

### 1. 🔮 Run the Interactive Intake & Diagnostic
Start an interactive terminal session that guides you through the Intake Questionnaire and generates a career diagnostic report utilizing LLMs (Gemini or Claude):
```bash
npx cybersec-career-coach
```

### 2. 📋 Copy the System Prompt to Clipboard
Copy the complete, ready-to-paste system prompt directly to your clipboard:
```bash
npx cybersec-career-coach copy
```
*Then paste it directly as a System Prompt into Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs, or Google AI Studio.*

### 🛠️ 3. Install the Modular Agentic Skill
If you use developer agents (like Claude Code or Google Antigravity), you can install the custom skill:
- **Local installation** (in your current project):
  ```bash
  npx cybersec-career-coach install
  ```
- **Global installation** (in your user config directory):
  ```bash
  npx cybersec-career-coach install --global
  ```

## 🔬 The 8-Dimension Gap Analysis Framework

The Oracle evaluates your profile across 8 distinct dimensions:
1. 🧠 **Knowledge Gaps**: Theoretical concepts required for the target role.
2. 🛠️ **Skill Gaps**: Practical tasks you can do independently (not just describe).
3. ⚙️ **Tool Gaps**: Hands-on experience with SIEMs, EDRs, hypervisors, etc.
4. 📜 **Certification Gaps**: Aligning credentials with target requirements.
5. 📂 **Portfolio Gaps**: Verifiable proof (GitHub repos, CTFs, lab write-ups).
6. 🌐 **Network Gaps**: Professional community presence and referral access.
7. 👁️ **Mindset Gaps**: Thinking patterns (e.g., defender vs. adversary).
8. 🗣️ **Communication Gaps**: Explaining technical risks in terms of business impact.
